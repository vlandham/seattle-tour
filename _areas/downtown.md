The central business district of Seattle. The commercial district was moved here after the Great Fire in 1889.

**Pike Place Market** opened in 1907 and is one of the oldest year-round public farmers markets in America. Prior to WWII, many (as much as 4/5ths) of the market vendors were Japanese-American. Because of Roosevelt's signing of Executive Order 9066 in 1942, these vendors were forced into internment camps. A mural hangs above the main entrance to the market to memorialize these deposed citizens.

Annual permit to sell in the market is (as of 2008) for farmers & craftspeople $35 and $30 for performers. Stalls rent for $6 - $33 a day, depending on the season. To sell on a Saturday, vendors must sell at the Market a minimum of two weekdays of the preceding week.

The unofficial mascot of the market is the Rachel the Pig statue. It was installed in 1986 and receives $6,000 - $9,000 annually.
