Seattle proper founded here in 1852.

By 1885, there were 12,000 people living in a ten block radius from Yesler Way.

Seattles "Great Fire" occurred in 1889. It was started by a glue pot boiling over.
As almost all the structures were wood built, the fire spread and destroyed 25 blocks.

The city rebuilt after the fire. Changing building codes to require brick and stone.
They also regraded the area and raised the "ground" up a story.
The streets and sidewalks were eventually built at this level, and the first story of many buildings were left underground (Now part of the Underground tour).

Pioneer Square is named after small public park, which is actually a triangle.

**Henry Yesler** built first sawmill on the waterfront in Seattle in 1850. Yesler Way is the origin of the term "skid row" - as logs were skidded down this road to the mill. Later this area


**Doc Maynard** was another Seattle founder. He was friends with Chief Sealth, the Suquamish/Duwamish tribe chief who Seattle gets its name from. Maynard claimed a 640 acre tract of land in Pioneer Square. He laid out streets in his claim according to the cardinal directions, but neighboring land owners insisted on following the curve of the sound. Awkward connection between Maynard's claim and the claim that became downtown Seattle can be seen here on Yesler Way.

**Smith Tower** was the tallest office building west of the Mississippi River until the completion of the Kansas City Power & Light Building in 1931. Named after its builder: Lyman Cornelius Smith. Smith founded the Smith-Premier Typewriter Company, but died before the tower was completed in 1914. The top originally hold a 10,000 gallon water tank, but is now a 3 story penthouse the only residence in the building.
