---

West Seattle was annexed to Seattle in 1907.

**Alki** was the original White settlement of what would become Seattle, before Pioneer Square was picked. The Denny Party landed in November of 1851. The original name of the settlement was "New York Alki", Alki being a Chinook Jargon term meaning "eventually" or "by and by".

**Alki Beach** is a 135.9-acre park. It contains a model replica of the Statue of Liberty that serves as a congregation point for locals.

**Luna Park** used to be a prominent attraction at the Northern point of Alki. Built in 1907, it included a German carousel, Ferris wheel, rollercoaster, and a boat chute ride. It burned down in 1954.
