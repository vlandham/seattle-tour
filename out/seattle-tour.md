# Downtown

The central business district of Seattle. The commercial district was moved here after the Great Fire in 1889.

**Pike Place Market** opened in 1907 and is one of the oldest year-round public farmers markets in America. Prior to WWII, many (as much as 4/5ths) of the market vendors were Japanese-American. Because of Roosevelt's signing of Executive Order 9066 in 1942, these vendors were forced into internment camps. A mural hangs above the main entrance to the market to memorialize these deposed citizens.

Annual permit to sell in the market is (as of 2008) for farmers & craftspeople $35 and $30 for performers. Stalls rent for $6 - $33 a day, depending on the season. To sell on a Saturday, vendors must sell at the Market a minimum of two weekdays of the preceding week.

The unofficial mascot of the market is the Rachel the Pig statue. It was installed in 1986 and receives $6,000 - $9,000 annually.

# Pioneer Square

Seattle proper founded here in 1852.

By 1885, there were 12,000 people living in a ten block radius from Yesler Way.

Seattles "Great Fire" occurred in 1889. It was started by a glue pot boiling over.
As almost all the structures were wood built, the fire spread and destroyed 25 blocks.

The city rebuilt after the fire. Changing building codes to require brick and stone.
They also regraded the area and raised the "ground" up a story.
The streets and sidewalks were eventually built at this level, and the first story of many buildings were left underground (Now part of the Underground tour).

Pioneer Square is named after small public park, which is actually a triangle.

**Henry Yesler** built first sawmill on the waterfront in Seattle in 1850. Yesler Way is the origin of the term "skid row" - as logs were skidded down this road to the mill. Later this area became associated with gambling and flop houses.

**Doc Maynard** was another Seattle founder. He was friends with Chief Sealth, the Suquamish / Duwamish tribe chief who Seattle gets its name from. Maynard claimed a 640 acre tract of land in Pioneer Square. He laid out streets in his claim according to the cardinal directions, but neighboring land owners insisted on following the curve of the sound. Awkward connection between Maynard's claim and the claim that became downtown Seattle can be seen here on Yesler Way.
